## Introduction
This project aims to develop a real-time fraud detection system leveraging Spark Streaming and machine learning for anomaly detection. The goal is to process streaming data in real-time to identify fraudulent transactions, focusing on system performance and efficiency. The system will integrate fundamental operating system concepts such as concurrency, memory management, and scheduling to handle large-scale, high-frequency data streams.

## Dataset
